# Setup Sparky Linux

A one-click installation script to set up and customize Sparky Linux 7.5 (or other Debian Bookworm-based distributions).

## Overview

This project aims to streamline the process of setting up a fresh Linux installation by automating the installation of commonly used software and configurations. The script is written in Bash and tailored for Sparky Linux, but it is flexible enough to work with other Debian Bookworm-based distributions like MX Linux and Linux Mint.

## Motivation

My main aim with this project is to learn the Bash language while addressing a personal need to simplify the setup of lightweight Linux systems.

To make the most out of my old computer, I’ve explored lightweight, resource-efficient Linux desktop systems. Through [DistroWatch.com](https://distrowatch.com/), I’ve tested nearly all the top 20 distributions and discovered the power of Linux live mode. Live mode has been invaluable for initial system testing, and I’ve noticed that the Linux desktop experience has significantly improved over the years, now rivaling about 90% of the usability of Windows systems.

### The Journey

To make trying out different systems easier, I came across [Ventoy](https://ventoy.net/), which has been a game-changer. With Ventoy, I copied dozens of Linux distributions onto a single USB drive, allowing me to boot any system on demand. This approach enabled me to bypass the limitations of typical Windows computers, access files, and use hardware without altering the hard drive.

Later, I wondered if this freedom could extend to Windows. After some research, I discovered **Windows To Go**, enabling me to install and run Windows directly from a high-speed USB drive. This became my primary Windows setup and solidified my enthusiasm for portable operating systems.

### Inspiration for This Script

When using official Linux distributions, I wanted a way to quickly install my favorite software. This sparked my interest in learning Bash programming to create a one-click installation script. Though progress was slow for many years, the idea persisted.

Recently, with the help of tools like **windsurf**, programming references, and various AI assistants, I finally completed version 0.3 of this script after a week of dedicated effort. Debugging was challenging—AI tools sometimes introduced subtle issues that required manual correction. Ultimately, I disabled windsurf’s auto-completion to ensure accuracy during the final debugging phases.

The script contains extensive comments to aid my learning and serve as a resource for others exploring Bash.

## Features

- Installs essential software and dependencies with a single command.
- Designed for Sparky Linux but adaptable to other Debian Bookworm-based systems.
- Commented extensively for learning purposes.

## Requirements

- A Debian Bookworm-based Linux distribution (e.g., Sparky Linux, MX Linux, or Linux Mint).
- Bash shell (default in most Linux distributions).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cogitate3/setupSparkyLinux.git
   cd setupSparkyLinux
   ```

2. Run the setup script:

   ```bash
   bash 901afterLinuxInstall.sh
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Next Steps:

- [x] One-click installation and configuration of zsh with its plugins and interface customization
- One-click configuration for mounting webdav remote folders
- One-click installation of Chinese input method
- Add auto-start configuration for plank
- Add auto-start configuration for angrysearch
- Add cloud storage
- Add webdav
- Add useful desktop screenshot translation software
- Test and optimize scripts for compatibility with MX Linux and Linux Mint distributions

## Future Plans

- Test and optimize the script for other Debian-based distributions.
- Continue refining Bash programming skills and improving the script’s functionality.
